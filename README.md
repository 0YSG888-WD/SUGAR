# SUGAR
### A web application designed to allow neighbors (users) to request essential items such as toilet paper or coffee, and other neighbors can fulfill the request out of the kindness of their heart. 
### Transactions are meant to be free, and delivered with no cost. 
### The goal of this project was to inspire kindness during such a difficult and unique time in all of our lives.

- Request listings from users pulled from database entries.
- Bold, eyecatching overlapping design presents a start contrast to the way information is typically displayed on websites. 
- Simple background perspective skew based on mouseover increases user experience - sugar molecules appear to be moving.
- Perspective skew chosen based on content of wallpaper, not randomly decided and incorporated for the sake of aesthetics.
