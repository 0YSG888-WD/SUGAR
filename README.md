# SUGAR
### A web application designed to allow neighbors (users) to request essential items such as toilet paper or coffee, and other neighbors can fulfill the request out of the kindness of their heart. 
### Transactions are meant to be free, and delivered with no cost. 
### The goal of this project was to inspire kindness during such a difficult and unique time in all of our lives.
